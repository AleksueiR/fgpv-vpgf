# Geosearch

Provides name, postal code, and NTS location based searching within Canada, using [GeoGratis](http://geogratis.gc.ca/) as the backend provider.

It can be configured to return only certain types of results like provinces or cities, and can be used in English or French.

    See the [configuration](/config) page for additional information.

## Custom vs UI

GeoSearch has functionality to make integrating search easy [in a webpage (demo)](/demo1). GeoSearch can also be implemented [programmatically](/demo2) for more advanced usage and control. 

There are precompiled javascript versions that can be found in the `dist` folder, as well as being able to import/require this library with a package manager.
